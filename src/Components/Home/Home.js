                                    Your treatment consists of attending therapeutic groups, individual sessions with therapists and medication your psychiatrist prescribes. Group therapy is compulsory: we see it as an indication of your commitment to your recovery.

                                    Yes. All medication (including non-prescription medication) must be declared on admission and handed to the nursing staff. It is important that your psychiatrist is fully aware of everything you are currently taking, as it may interact with your new prescribed medication. All medication is strictly administered according to your doctorâ€™s prescription.
                                    You need to be able to identify your prescribed medication, and we urge you not to take any medication if you are not certain it is the correct prescribed medication. Please talk to your doctor regarding the effects of the medication you are taking. You should arrange for your doctor to complete your chronic medication documentation prior to discharge.
